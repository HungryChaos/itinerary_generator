# Multi-Agent AI System

This project implements a simple multi-agent AI system where individual agents interact with a simulated environment. The system is designed to demonstrate basic principles of agent-based modeling and reinforcement learning.

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, run:

```
npm install
```

## Usage

To run the simulation, execute the following command:

```
npm start
```

## Classes and Functions

- **Agent**: Represents an individual AI agent with methods to initialize, act, and learn.
- **Environment**: Simulates the environment in which agents operate, with methods to setup, reset, and step through the simulation.
- **Utility Functions**: Includes functions like `generateRandomNumber` and `calculateReward` to assist in various calculations.
